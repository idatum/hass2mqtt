This is a different take on the offical Home Assistant MQTT Statestream integration: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt_statestream/

Implemented in C# and .NET 5, and using Docker, Home Assistant events are subscribed via its WebSocket API and sent to an MQTT broker. The full state_changed event payload is passed as the MQTT message payload.

Client event processing can use the full state_changed payload for a stateless implementation of the code that processes these events. The MQTT Statestream integration instead requires the client to retain state between each topic if processing requires more than one attribute. For example, if you need to log both the state and the friendly name, you need to retain state of each to log both.

A configuration file -- overrided by environment variables -- allows for specific integrations in your environment.
Configuration also allows for specific inclusions of Home Assistant entities, implicitly skipping other entities outside the inclusion set; default is to publish all state change events.
